# Before You Begin

In the sections that follow, we will work you through an example of how to release an NEP-5 asset on NEO blockchain, which includes the tasks of development environment set-up and configuration, smart contract compilation, smart contract deployment, and smart contract invocation on private chain.

Neo provides two full-node clients: NEO-GUI and NEO-CLI. This tutorial is based on the usage of Neo-CLI.

## System environment

NEO-CLI runs in the following environments: 

- Windows 10
- Ubuntu 16.04/18.04
- CentOS 7.4/7.6

### Download Neo-CLI
