# Installing NEO-CLI

You can choose one of the following ways to install NEO-CLI:

- Install the official NEO-CLI released package
- or publish NEO-CLI source code from GitHub into an executable file. If you use macOS, this way is highly recommended.

This document will describe the two installation ways.

## Installing NEO-CLI package

1. Download the latest [Neo-CLI](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-cli/releases) package according to your operating system on Github and unzip it.

2. On Linux, install the LevelDB and SQLite3 dev packages. For example, on ubuntu 18.04 run the following:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install libleveldb-dev sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev libunwind8-dev
   ```

   If using Windows, you can skip this step as those files are already included in the installation package.

## Publishing from NEO-CLI source code

You can download and compile the Neo-CLI source directly from Github.

> [!Note] 
>
> - The neo-cli master branch is only applicable to the neo-cli 3.x version which is under development
> - The NEO main net node version is neo-cli-2.X. To switch to this version, you should change to this branch: $ git checkout master-2.x
