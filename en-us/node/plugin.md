# Plug-ins for NEO Client

Since NEO 2.9.0 some additional functionalities are individually encapsulated in plug-ins for the purpose of improving node security, stability, and flexibility. The user can select the desired extension functionality instead of invoking it with additional parameters every time starting neo-cli, thus avoiding many human errors and some tedious instructions such as opening a wallet and calling applicationlogs.
