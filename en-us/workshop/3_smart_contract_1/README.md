## Outline
This workshop covers how to use the Neo development environment to develop basic smart contracts for the Neo platform. It will also cover the deployment process as well as how to invoke the contracts. This workshop will be branching and will support C#, python, and typescript contract development and their environments.


## Tools
* <i><b>Note:</b> Tools are flagged with language designators for clarity.  Depending on your implementation path, you may be using cross language libraries (for example, writing a smart contract in python, but interfacing in javascript). </i>

#### Writing a contract
* C#
* Python
* Typescript
* Golang

#### Deploying a contract
* C#
* Python
* Typescript
* Javascript
* Golang

#### Interfacing with the contract
* Python
* Typescript

* Golang

## Introduction and Setup
* 10 minutes

## Writing a contract
* Overview of contract
* NEP5 example w/ links to multiple languages
* Output example .avm and bytecode

## Deploying a Contract
* Overview of deployment costs
* Deployment example on event-net

## Invoking a Contract
* Invocation costs
* Example invokation using neo-gui
* Example invocation using neon.js
* Example invocation using neo-python

### Local Invokes v. Published Invokes
* Differences in how each works
* How to leverage the difference in your architecture
