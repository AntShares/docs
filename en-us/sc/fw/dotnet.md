# Smart contract .NET framework

The .NET Framework is an encapsulation of the Smart Contract API so that .NET programmers can use the classes, methods, and properties of .NET directly to interact with the API to obtain block-chain data, Storage area and so on.

## Namespaces

| Namespace | description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| [Neo](dotnet/neo.md) | The NEO namespace is the API provided by the NEO blockchain, providing a way to access the block-chain data and manipulate the persistent store. |
| The [System](dotnet/system.md) | System namespace is the API provided by the Smart Contract Execution Engine (NeoVM), which provides access to the execution environment that accesses the smart contract. |
